# Embedded_GUI
Using Lightweight, Beautiful GUI framework (LVGL) for some kind of my Project.

In this project, I use ESP32 with Arduino with RTOS.
Although i tried to use ESP-IDF but LVGL library for IDF pretty buggy and old.

This devices feature so far:
- Get time and weather from OpenWeatherMap API with pretty good UI.
- Printer interface.
- Touch Screen.
